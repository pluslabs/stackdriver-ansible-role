module: stackdriver_facts
short_description: Gather facts about the Stackdriver agent installation.
description:
  - Gathers facts about the Stackdriver agent installation.
  - This returns just one fact, C(stackdriver_host_id), specifying the ID by
    which the host is known to the Stackdriver service.
  - On EC2 or GCE, this is normally the instance ID.
  - The module invocation fails if the Stackdriver agent is not installed.
